In this new episode of doing fun things with Colab and Python, we will use Deep Learning to crop out objects from one image and paste them on to another.

The deep learning part is Image Segmentation aka identifying objects in images which we can subsequently mask and ultimately crop out.

We use the awesome Opencv library for all the cutting and pasting with a dash of Pillow when the authors limited knowledge of Opencv became too obvious.
